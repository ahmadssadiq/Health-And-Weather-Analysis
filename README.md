# Health and Weather Analyzer

## Overview

The Health and Weather Analyzer is an innovative application that correlates real-time weather data with health statistics. It aims to provide users with personalized health recommendations based on current weather conditions. This can range from warning asthma patients about potential risks on high pollen days to suggesting activities tailored to the day's weather.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development:

1. Run the development server using: 
    npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Features

- **Personalized Health Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on weather conditions and individual health data.
- **Third-Party Authentication**: Users can log in using their Google account for personalized alerts and recommendations.
- **Real-Time Data**: Utilizes live weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and public health statistics API for accurate recommendations.

## GitHub Repository Migration

We have migrated to a new GitHub repository to maintain a cleaner code structure and resolve issues encountered with React in our previous repository. This migration ensures a streamlined development process. Our previous work, including commits, can be viewed at the [old GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jzhang011127/cs411-group-23/).
